/**
 * AuthorizationGuard is a custom guard that extends the default JWT AuthGuard.
 * It determines whether the current request is authorized to proceed based on the presence of an authorization token
 * or whether the route is marked as public.

 * @extends AuthGuard
 * @constructor
 * @param {Reflector} reflector - An instance of the Reflector class used to access metadata.
 *
 * @method canActivate
 * @memberof AuthorizationGuard
 * @param {ExecutionContext} context - The execution context which provides details about the current request.
 * @returns {boolean} - A boolean indicating whether the request is authorized.
 *
 * The canActivate method performs the following checks:
 * 1. If an authorization token is present in the request headers, it delegates the authorization check to the parent class.
 * 2. If no authorization token is present, it checks if the route is marked as public. If the route is public, access is granted; otherwise, access is denied.
